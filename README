NAME
    Graphics::ColorNames - defines RGB values for common color names

REQUIREMENTS
    `Graphics::ColorNames' should work on Perl 5.6.0. It requires the
    following non-standard modules:

      Module::Load

INSTALLATION
    Installation can be done using the traditional Makefile.PL or the newer
    Build.PL methods.

    Using Makefile.PL:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use `nmake' instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build test
      perl Build install

SYNOPSIS
      use Graphics::ColorNames qw( hex2tuple tuple2hex );

      tie %ColorTable, 'Graphics::ColorNames', 'X';

      $rgbhex1 = $ColorTable{'green'};    # returns '00ff00'
      $rgbhex2 = tuple2hex( 0, 255, 0 );  # returns '00ff00'
      @rgbtup  = hex2tuple( $rgbhex );    # returns (0, 255, 0)

      $rgbhex3 = $ColorTable{'#123abc'};  # returns '123abc'
      $rgbhex4 = $ColorTable{'123abc'};   # returns '123abc'

DESCRIPTION
    This module defines RGB values for common color names. The intention is
    to (1) provide a common module that authors can use with other modules
    to specify colors by name; and (2) free module authors from having to
    "re-invent the wheel" whenever they decide to give the users the option
    of specifying a color by name rather than RGB value.

    See the module POD for complete documentation.
