    0.22  15 Mar 2001
	- added example on how to add your own naming schema

SYNOPSIS
      use Graphics::ColorNames qw( hex2tuple tuple2hex );

      tie %NameTable, 'Graphics::ColorNames', 'X';

      my $rgbhex = $NameTable{'green'};    # returns '00ff00'
      my $rgbhex = tuple2hex( 0, 255, 0 )  # returns '00ff00'
      my @rgbtup = hex2tuple( $rgbhex );   # returns (0, 255, 0)

DESCRIPTION
    This module defines RGB values for common color names. The intention is
    to (1) provide a common module that authors can use with other modules
    to specify colors; and (2) free module authors from having to "re-invent
    the wheel" whenever they decide to give the users the option of
    specifying a color by name rather than RGB value.

    A more detailed description with documentation can be found in the
    module's POD.
