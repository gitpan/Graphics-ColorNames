NAME
    Graphics::ColorNames - defines RGB values for common color names

REQUIREMENTS
    `Graphics::ColorNames' should work on Perl 5.6.0.

    It requires the following non-standard modules:

      Module::Load

  Installation

    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build
      perl Build test
      perl Build install    

SYNOPSIS
      use Graphics::ColorNames qw( hex2tuple tuple2hex );

      tie %NameTable, 'Graphics::ColorNames', 'X';

      my $rgbhex1 = $NameTable{'green'};    # returns '00ff00'
      my $rgbhex2 = tuple2hex( 0, 255, 0 ); # returns '00ff00'
      my @rgbtup  = hex2tuple( $rgbhex );   # returns (0, 255, 0)

      my $rgbhex3 = $NameTable{'#123abc'};  # returns '123abc'
      my $rgbhex4 = $NameTable{'123abc'};   # returns '123abc'

DESCRIPTION
    This module defines RGB values for common color names. The intention is
    to (1) provide a common module that authors can use with other modules
    to specify colors; and (2) free module authors from having to "re-invent
    the wheel" whenever they decide to give the users the option of
    specifying a color by name rather than RGB value.

    A more detailed description with documentation can be found in the
    module's POD.

HISTORY
    Revision history since the last release:

    2.0_01  Mon Apr  4 2005
	- removed DSLIP information from POD, since it has little meaning
	- tweaked code
	- color scheme can be a module name
	- fixed bug in Pod::Coverage test, uses Test::Pod::Coverage
	* major change in how schemes are stored, which affects priority
	  when CODE scheme types are used
	- can load rgb.txt from GLOB, FileHandle or IO::File
	- references can be specified as possible schemes in constructor
	- added public load_scheme method
	- various optimizations and tweaks
	- IO::File is loaded only as needed
	- rgb.txt file must be radable to be loaded
	- tweaked tests
	- RGB passthrough now consistently returns lowercase values
	- minor optimization in FETCH for RGB passthrough
	- added all_schemes function to query schemes
