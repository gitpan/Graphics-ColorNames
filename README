NAME
    Graphics::ColorNames - defines RGB values for common color names

SYNOPSIS
      use Graphics::ColorNames qw( hex2tuple );

      tie %NameTable, 'Graphics::ColorNames', 'X';

      my $rgbhex = $NameTable{'green'};  # returns '00ff00'
      my @rgbtup = hex2tuple( $rgbhex ); # returns (0, 255, 0)

DESCRIPTION
    This module defines RGB values for common color names. The intention is
    to (1) provide a common module that authors can use with other modules
    to specify colors; and (2) free module authors from having to "re-invent
    the wheel" whenever they decide to give the users the option of
    specifying a color by name rather than RGB value.

  Usage

    The interface is through a tied hash:

      tie %NAMETABLE, 'Graphics::ColorNames', SCHEME

    where `%NAMETABLE' is the tied hash and `SCHEME' is the color scheme.
    Currently three schemes are available:

    X   550 color names used in X-Windows. *This is the default naming
        scheme*, since it provides the most names.

    HTML
        16 common color names defined in the HTML 4.0 specification. These
        names are also used with CSS and SVG.

    Windows
        16 commom color names used with Microsoft Windows and related
        products. These are actually the same colors as `HTML', although
        with different names.

    RGB values can be retrieved with a case-insensitive hash key:

      $rgb = $colors{'AliceBlue'};

    The value returned is in the six-digit hexidecimal format used in HTML
    and CSS (without the initial '#'). To convert it to separate red, green,
    and blue values (between 0 and 255), use the `hex2tuple' function:

      @rgb = hex2tuple( $colors{'AliceBlue'} );

    The `hex2tuple' function is not exported by default. You must specify it
    explicitly when you 'use' the module.

CAVEAT
    This module is experimental. The interface may change.
