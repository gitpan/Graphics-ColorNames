    Graphics::ColorNames - defines RGB values for common color names

REQUIREMENTS
    `Graphics::ColorNames' should work on Perl 5.005.

    It uses only standard modules.

  Installation

    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

HISTORY
    Revision history since v0.23:

    0.24  28 Apr 2001
	- fixed  colors in X.pm (such as some 'green') defined as 0x000000
	- removed duplicate grays (ie, 'gray0') from X.pm
	- renamed test suite files to enforce testing order
	- v0.23 mistakenly dated 17 March instead of 17 April 2001

SYNOPSIS
      use Graphics::ColorNames qw( hex2tuple tuple2hex );

      tie %NameTable, 'Graphics::ColorNames', 'X';

      my $rgbhex = $NameTable{'green'};    # returns '00ff00'
      my $rgbhex = tuple2hex( 0, 255, 0 )  # returns '00ff00'
      my @rgbtup = hex2tuple( $rgbhex );   # returns (0, 255, 0)

DESCRIPTION
    This module defines RGB values for common color names. The intention is
    to (1) provide a common module that authors can use with other modules
    to specify colors; and (2) free module authors from having to "re-invent
    the wheel" whenever they decide to give the users the option of
    specifying a color by name rather than RGB value.

    A more detailed description with documentation can be found in the
    module's POD.
